# Product sample feedback revision list

After each round of samples, your product lead gets one revision list by sample version and feature: the changes people agree on, the feedback that conflicts, and drafted notes for the next supplier brief. The product owner decides.

## The outcome

When a supplier sends a second or third sample, the comments arrive from every direction: testers and customer panel members. Some refer to a version that has since changed, some have no label, and some pull in opposite directions. This capability turns them into one list that is sorted by sample version and by feature, so the team can see at a glance what is settled and what is not.

Agreed changes sit in one place, each with the notes behind it. Conflicting feedback sits in another, with both sides side by side and the concept brief beside them. Preferences are kept apart from observations, single comments are not dressed up as agreement, and a change the supplier says it made but nobody has tried is flagged. Earlier revision requests are checked against the latest sample, so nothing asked for in round one quietly drops out.

The list ends with drafted notes for the next supplier brief, built only from what is agreed. The product owner resolves the conflicts and approves the brief before anything goes to the supplier. Questions about materials, strength or safety are passed to the right specialist as written, with no judgment attached.

## Who starts the work, and when

The product lead starts it when a round of sample feedback is in, and again after each new sample. The product owner reads the list and settles the conflicts. Sourcing and quality read the finished list.

## What they supply

- A sample register: each sample's identifier, version, date received, supplier and whether it is labelled, with any changes the supplier says it made.
- The dated feedback notes, each tied to a sample, a person and a feature.
- The concept brief, with its features and what is required of each.
- Earlier revision requests: what was asked, when, and what the supplier said it did.

## What comes out

One list in a fixed order: agreed changes by version and feature, conflicting feedback, single comments, what is reported as working, questions for specialists, the status of earlier requests, untested supplier changes, drafted notes for the next brief and the decisions only the product owner can make. Every line points back to a note or the register. A note that cannot be tied to a sample is set aside with a question rather than guessed at.

See the worked example with invented data in [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md).

## Where it fits

- [Product management](https://fullypowered.ai/functions/product-management/), where the revision list is the working record between one sample and the next.
- [Consumer brands](https://fullypowered.ai/industries/consumer-brands/), for teams developing products with outside suppliers.
- [E-commerce & retail](https://fullypowered.ai/industries/ecommerce-and-retail/), for own-label ranges developed with a supplier.
- [Hardware & physical technology](https://fullypowered.ai/industries/hardware-and-physical-technology/), for devices and accessories that go through several sample rounds.
- [New business lines](https://fullypowered.ai/situations/new-business-lines/), when the first product in a new category goes through its first samples.
- [Growth & scaling](https://fullypowered.ai/situations/growth-and-scaling/), when more people comment on samples and the notes no longer fit in one head.

This is different from [customer feedback themes](https://fullypowered.ai/capabilities/customer-feedback-themes/), which groups what customers say about a product already on sale, and from the [acceptance criteria sheet](https://fullypowered.ai/capabilities/acceptance-criteria-sheet/), which defines done for a software story. This one reconciles feedback on specific samples, version by version.

## What has to change for your company

List the features you review a sample on, and use the same words in the concept brief and the notes. Decide how many different people must raise a point before it counts as agreed; the default is two. Name who resolves conflicts, who approves the supplier brief, and which specialist takes technical, materials and safety questions. Fix your sample label format. Decide how the brief is sent to the supplier; this capability never sends it.

## What has been checked

Fully Powered AI wrote this capability template. It was editorially reviewed on 10 November 2026. It was tried on its invented example in Claude on 10 November 2026, and run again after the wording was clarified; the record of the second run is published with it. It has not yet been tested in a client environment. It has not yet been tested as a packaged version in ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot or Gemini.

Testing in your environment means running it on a past sample round your product lead already knows, with cases written in advance: a note with no sample label, two testers who disagree, a supplier change nobody tried. The product lead checks every line against the original notes before anyone relies on it. [Pilot acceptance-test preparation](https://fullypowered.ai/capabilities/pilot-acceptance-test-preparation/) sets those cases up, and [what we test before we call an AI workflow ready](https://fullypowered.ai/insights/what-we-test-before-a-workflow-is-ready/) describes the record we keep.

- Written by Fully Powered AI.
- Sources and rights reviewed.
- Editorially reviewed on 10 November 2026.
- Package format checked by script on every release.
- Tried once on its invented example in Claude on 10 November 2026. The record is in [TRIAL.md](TRIAL.md).
- Not yet tested in a client environment.

## What is in this folder

- [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md): the complete capability template. Roles, inputs, the procedure, exceptions and stop conditions, the output format, a reviewer checklist, acceptance tests, the instructions for an AI assistant and what to customize.
- [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md): a worked example with invented data.
- [TRIAL.md](TRIAL.md): what came out when the template was tried on its example.
- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): the technical file, for AI products that load packaged instructions from a folder.
- [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md): what the capability drew on, with licences.
- [LICENSE](LICENSE): MIT. Use it, change it, make it yours.

## Start using it

1. Read [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md) to see what a good result looks like.
2. Open [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) and set every item under "What to customize" to your own rules, roles and limits.
3. Give your AI assistant the instruction block and the output format from the template, with your own limits in place of the ones the instructions leave open in square brackets. Paste them in as custom instructions in ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot or Gemini, or copy this whole folder into a product that loads `SKILL.md` packages. This folder stands alone; you do not need the rest of the repository.
4. Run it on past work first, using the reviewer checklist and acceptance tests in the template, before anyone relies on it.
